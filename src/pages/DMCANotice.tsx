            DamiTV.pro is an Internet Service Provider offering a platform that merely displays links to audiovisual content located on servers of third parties and provided and/or transmitted by third parties. DamiTV.pro does not host nor transmit any audiovisual content itself and does not control nor influence such content. DamiTV.pro cannot accept any liability for the content transmitted by others. Any responsibility for this content lies with those who host or transmit it.

          <p>
            Of course, DamiTV.pro is concerned about allegations that illegal content is made available on the websites to which hyperlinks on its website direct. Although DamiTV.pro cannot actively monitor the content which is transmitted via third-party websites, it is willing to take action in removing links to illegal content upon obtaining proper notice thereof. DamiTV.pro will remove links to illegal content from its website expeditiously; however, it cannot prevent that links are replaced by visitors of its website. To prevent a link from being replaced again after being removed by DamiTV.pro, we advise you to contact the owner of the website where the content originates from.
